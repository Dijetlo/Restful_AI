# Restful_AI
Python 3.6 web server:
- Requirement: Currently tested on python3.6 only. Use of interpolitive strings restricts earlier versions.
- Simple web server currently implemented with a "longest common substring " gizmo attached at /lcs
- Set to use localhost on port 7777 (localhost:7777/lcs)

##Installation
There are no dependencies outside the python3.6 Standard Template Library asociated with this web server. 
Batteries included.
Currently this is a single use implementation for the lcs functionality so the file "lcs_responses.py" from this git is also required. The two files, webserver36.py and lcs_responses must live in the same directory.

- Downloade webser36.py and lcs_resonses.py to the executoin directory of your choosing
- Mark them as executable based on the operating system you are using
#  --> /path/to/your/python3.6/binaries webserver36.py
